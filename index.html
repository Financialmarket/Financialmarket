                                                                   <br>The most common fixed income investment is the bond. These asset classes are classified as income in that they provide a stable and generally reliable revenue stream. 
                                                                   <br>A bond works like a subscription, whereby you lend your money to an issuer for a specified period of time in exchange for paying interest over the course of your investment. If all goes well, your investment, or principal, will be repaid to you in full at a predetermined term, known as a "maturity". 
                                                                </p>

                                                                                                                     <ul>

The floating rate bonds, other things being equal, are safer, as they always offer returns in line with those of the market.</li>
                                                                                                                     </ul>

                                                                                                                          <ul>
                                                                                                                             <li>an ordinary bond component, which may or may not provide for the payment of periodic coupons and which ensures the repayment of the nominal value of the security;</li>
                                                                                                                             <li>  a derivative contract, which makes the investor's remuneration dependent on the performance of one or more financial or real parameters, such as indices or combinations of stock market indices, shares, mutual funds, exchange rates or commodities.</li>

                                                                                                                                <ul>

                                                                                                                                </ul>

In the absence of a secondary market, the investor would most likely have to wait for the security to expire in order to disinvest his position.

                                                                                                                                         <li>Credit risk:  credit risk (or issuer risk), which is linked to the possibility that the issuer is defaulting, in whole or in part, in the payment of interest and / or principal.</li>
                                                                                                                                      </ul>
                                                                   In this respect, there are securities of different risk levels, since not all Issuers have the same reliability. For example, a state is generally more reliable than a private enterprise and, in fact, the failure of a state, although possible, is less likely than that of an enterprise.

In fact, subordinated bonds exist, for which the payment of the coupons and the repayment of the capital, in case of particular financial difficulties of the issuer, depend on the satisfaction of the other non-subordinated creditors. 
                                                                   <br>

								<h2 class="major">Rating</h2>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/pic04.JPG" alt="" /></span>
								<p>The rating is a judgment that is expressed by an external and independent entity, the rating agency, about the ability of a company to pay its debts or not. The ratings of the rating agencies are used to calculate the yield on the bonds and therefore the cost of debt for the issuers. In other words, the rating represents one of the factors that establish the cost of the loan and the consequent repayment conditions. The rating can help investors to monitor the value of their investment over time: the eventual downgrade of an issuer by a rating agency is, in fact, a clear warning signal to the markets and individual investors who, otherwise, wouldn't have the ability to detect the needs to restructure its activities. 
                                                                </p>
								<p><strong>Types of ratings</strong></p>
                                                                <p><strong>(credit, debt, country ceiling)</strong>
                                                                   <br>
                                                                   <br>The credit rating is issued on a company's debt, but it is only a specific type of rating. There are international credit ratings that evaluate the risks, and therefore the expenses, of an investor who wants to transfer the securities expressed in the currency of another country into the currency of his country. Then there are the debt ratings of the nations. Since the states are the biggest debtors ever, the rating agencies evaluate and classify the securities of their debt based on the capacity that the same states demonstrate to face them. Another type of rating is the so-called "Country ceiling rating" which values the risks of an investment in a state, that can implement measures to block any capital outflows from its borders. With this type of rating, investors can also evaluate this type of risk. 
                                                                   <br>
                                                                   <br>The close link between these last three types of ratings appears evident, but there are also other types of ratings that rating agencies are capable of issuing. 
                                                                </p>
                                                                <p><strong>Issue of the rating</strong></p>
                                                                   First of all, the balance sheet is analysed in all its components and some parameters such as the profitability of the company, its ability to produce resources and income, the return of capital, cash flows, the relationship between equity and the debt and so on. The analysts of the rating agency must in fact compare the parameters of the company they are examining, with those of the other companies in the sector in which it operates and must also analyse the characteristics of that sector and the market trend. 
                                                                   The company under examination must then provide all the information and documentation necessary to the rating agency itself by filling a questionnaire prepared by the rating agency on the basis of the first information obtained. Once the evaluation to be assigned has been established and the publication of the results has been decided, the rating is published on a press release on the agency's website and through the main financial media worldwide. 
                                                                </p>
                                                                <p><strong>Calculation of the rating</strong></p>
                                                                   The rating is assigned by marking the rating according to different scales of values that vary to the agency that issues the rating itself. The scale of the values that can be assigned is however an alphabetical scale. Another ranking typically used by rating agencies involves dividing the analysis over a short, medium or long-term temporal scale that can range from a period lasting a month to a period long year. 
                                                                </p>
